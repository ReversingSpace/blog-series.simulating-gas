# blog-series.simulating-gas

Code from the blog series on simulating gas.  Put here on a post-by-post basis to retain it safely outside of the blog posts.

Some differences exist in identical files between posts, and while they may be mentioned in posts, I'm keeping them distinct here (i.e. as complete files), rather than supplying diffs on the original.
